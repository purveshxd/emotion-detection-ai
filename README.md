# Emotion Detection

This college-based ML project harnesses machine learning and computer vision to detect human emotion. It seamlessly integrates a custom ML model into a Flutter app using the tflite_v2 package. Plus, we've transformed the model into a tflite version with TensorFlow. Feel the power of emotion detection!"

### Development status

I've added everything I wanted to add for my personal needs. If requested, I can add more features, but unless I come up with more ideas on functionalities or find bugs while using it, the development will be on pause for now.
